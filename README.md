# AES-FILE-ENCRYPTION
An AES-256 bit file encryption tool written in C#.

This is a tool all written in C#, that will encrypt and decrypt any file type with 256 bit AES encryption.

Note-- If you want to edit this and compile it yourself you'll have to change the salt from the default one I set there.
The pre-compiled executable I put in the root directory of the repository has my own salt in there.
